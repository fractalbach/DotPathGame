# About the Game

I got the idea for this game while reading *Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery* (CACM).  There was a puzzle on the last page which I took an interest in: *Partitioned Peace* By Dennis Shasha. 

* Dennis Shasha. 2017. Partitioned peace. *Commun*. ACM 60, 10 (September 2017), 112-ff. DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1145/3133244>
